Hello, My name is Igor Drogaitsev.

This is my frontend portfolio. Welcome to explore it.

A little bit about me:

For 5 years I have been working with interfaces and data visualization and for 2 years with Front-end.

Most of all I appreciate WIN-WIN cooperation. From my part, I always try to dive deep into the project to constatnly deliver value for the company. In projects I'm looking for challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.

This Portfolio helps me to represent my projects and get in touch with me.
