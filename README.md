Hello, My name is Igor Drogaitsev.

This is my frontend portfolio. Welcome to explore it.

A little bit about me:

5 years I work with interfaces and data visualization and 2 years with Front-end.

Most of all I appreciate WIN-WIN cooperation. From my side, I try to constantly learn to be useful for the company. In projects I'm looking for the opportunity to challenge and develop my skills.

This portfolio helps me to show my best projects and leave contacts.
